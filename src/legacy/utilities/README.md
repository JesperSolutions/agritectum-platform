# Legacy Utilities Archive

This directory contains utility functions that have been replaced or consolidated.

## Purpose

Utilities moved here are kept for:

- Reference during migration
- Understanding utility evolution
- Potential rollback if needed

## Utilities

See [ARCHIVE_MANIFEST.md](../ARCHIVE_MANIFEST.md) for a complete inventory.

## Migration Guidelines

When referencing legacy utilities:

1. Check ARCHIVE_MANIFEST.md for migration path
2. Use the replacement utility from main directories
3. Update imports to point to new locations
4. Do not use legacy utilities in new code
