# Legacy Components Archive

This directory contains components that have been replaced, deprecated, or are no longer actively used in the application.

## Purpose

Components moved here are kept for:

- Reference and historical context
- Potential rollback if needed
- Migration documentation
- Understanding of code evolution

## Components

See [ARCHIVE_MANIFEST.md](../ARCHIVE_MANIFEST.md) for a complete inventory.

## Migration Guidelines

When referencing legacy components:

1. Check ARCHIVE_MANIFEST.md for migration path
2. Look for replacement component in main `src/components/` directory
3. Review commit history for context
4. Do not use legacy components in new code
