- After each major reasoning cycle:
  - success_score (0–1)
  - repetition_flag (true / false)
  - new_heuristic (text)
  - next_action (summary)
- Append entry to /omnissiah_memory/reflections/.
- If repetition_flag = true three times → create “Pattern Axiom” in Knowledge Vault.
- Weekly meta-reflection:
  - Aggregate scores → compute average success.
  - Identify top recurring issues.
  - Update diagnostic heuristics.
- Monthly audit:
  - Validate all SRS references.
  - Rebuild vault index; remove stale logs.
