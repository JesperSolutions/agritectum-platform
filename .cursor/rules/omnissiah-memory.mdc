- Maintain three artifacts:
  1. ISSUE_CODEX.md
  2. KNOWLEDGE_VAULT.md
  3. SRS.md (generate if absent)
- Cross-link all three; archive, never delete.
- Prefer verified timestamps to resolve conflicts.
- Use {{project_name}} and {{language}} tags when storing context.
- Rebuild indices weekly; flag drift over 10%.
